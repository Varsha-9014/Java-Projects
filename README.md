# 📘 Introduction to Java

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It's designed to be **platform-independent**, meaning Java programs can run on any device equipped with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android), and web-based systems.

## 🚀 Key Concepts in Java

### 1. 🔤 **Syntax and Structure**
- Case-sensitive language
- Class-based structure
- Statements end with `;`

### 2. 🧱 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**
- **Class & Object**: Core building blocks.
- **Inheritance**: One class can inherit fields and methods from another.
- **Encapsulation**: Keeping data private using access modifiers.
- **Polymorphism**: One method, many forms (overloading/overriding).
- **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details using abstract classes or interfaces.

### 3. 🏗️ **Java Components**
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Tools for Java development.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Required to run Java programs.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Executes Java bytecode.

### 4. 🧰 **Common Features**
- **Automatic Garbage Collection**
- **Multithreading Support**
- **Exception Handling**
- **Rich API and Libraries**

### 5. 📂 **Packages and Imports**
- Organize code using packages.
- Reuse code with imports.

### 6. 📦 **Java Libraries and Frameworks**
- **Standard Library**: `java.util`, `java.io`, `java.net`, etc.
- **Popular Frameworks**: Spring, Hibernate, JavaFX
